# Sick-Game
This is a very on again off again project. I am extremely proud of the current state but without an artist to see the vision through my motivation takes a hit to continue it on

## Setup
To set up the project you need to install the version of Unity this project uses (2021.1.16f1). You can find all version of unity [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) and install them through the Unity Hub.

Once you have cloned and opened this project you can create a folder called "Testing Areas". Here you can create whatever you want and it won't be commited to the repository (its part of the .gitignore). This is where you should create your scene. Please refer to the [Jira Wiki](https://debug-test-company-name.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DTCN/pages/2031635/Wiki?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiYTYyYzY2NWIzZTMwNDNjYWFlNDg0NWM4NjIzYjAxMTciLCJwIjoiaiJ9) on how to set up your testing area. This includes:
- Creating a level using Unity's tilemap
- Creating a character to move around
- Creating AI and assigning decision trees to the AI
- Adding UI to the scene
